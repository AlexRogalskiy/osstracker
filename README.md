OSS Tracker
==========

OSS Tracker is an application that collects information about an github organization from Github and helps, through various
visualizations and emails, helps an organization understand how “healthy” each project (repository) is.  By health, we mean how
actively we are maintaining the project and engaging with external users.  At a high level we’ll start with focusing on projects
that are ignoring opened issues and pull requests.  Longer term, we’ll have deeper analysis to compute and take action on
an aggregate health metric.
